Just do a mk and run the resulting binary.  Rio works as normal,
except that mid-clicking outside of any window brings up a menu with
the different virtual desktops listed.

To my knowledge, this works just like p9p rio's virtual desktops.

Update: Changed vswitch() so it first undraws the old windows, *then*
redraws the new ones.  Seems slightly better.
