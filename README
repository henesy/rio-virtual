Just do a mk and run the resulting binary.  Rio works as normal,
except that mid-clicking outside of any window brings up a menu with
the different virtual desktops listed.

To my knowledge, this works just like p9p rio's virtual desktops.

The new option -n will enable "nostalgia mode", which for now emulates
the 8½ window border color and style.
